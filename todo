The algorithm that sorts objects (not the triangles!) for possible collisions (rpy.cpp) is wrong.
It only compares successive objects and if they don't collide, it assumes that the next object doesn't collide with
any previous object. This however is wrong, because one of the previous objects can be much bigger, than the immediate
predecessor.
